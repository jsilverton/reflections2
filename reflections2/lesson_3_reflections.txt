Reflect: Using a remote repository
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- when want other people to share it
- when want to access code from multiple of my own computers
- for safety

Reflect: Manual vs. automatic pull
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- may want stable base of code to work with


Reflect: Forks, Clones, and Branches

Reflect: Local copies of remote branches
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
